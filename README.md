This repo includes the construction of LSTM-FCN algorithms for fracture detection task. The training data used are generated by forward wellbore-reservoir thermal models at injection, warmback and static stages. 
The organization of the four folders are shown below:
# forward model
This folder includes a 
# injection
# warmback
# static
# noise sensitivity and information combination
