# Geothermal-
This repo includes the construction of LSTM-FCN algorithms for fracture detection task. The training data used are generated by forward wellbore-reservoir thermal models at injection, warmback and static stages.
All of data are stored in: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11062049

The organization of the five folders are shown below:
# forward model
The training and validation temperature data at the three stages are generated by the numerical solver in this folder. 
# injection
This folder includes the construction of the LSTM-FCN algorithm for multi fracture detection by single stage injection temperature data; and the well-trained algorithm (the pt file) used for a real case test.
# warmback
This folder includes the construction of the LSTM-FCN algorithm for multi fracture detection by single stage warmback temperature data; and the well-trained algorithm (the pt file) used for a real case test.
# static
This folder includes the construction of the LSTM-FCN algorithm for multi fracture detection by single static temperature data; and the well-trained algorithm (the pt file) used for a real case test.
# Noise sensitivity and information combination
This folder includes the construction of LSTM-FCN algorithms for multi fracture detection by noisy single stage temperature data, and by combined temperature data from various stages, to discuss the noise sensitivity and the influence of multistage information combination.
